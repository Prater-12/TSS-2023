# Assignment
Week 1 has come to an end. You were introduced to the world of app development, you learnt using Git and GitHub and learnt how to code in dart. So, it's time for putting what you have learnt to use. 
# Tasks
* Create a repository with the name: **RollNumber_IntroToAppDev(Example: 200040066_IntroToAppDev)**
* Make a simple **Counter** Application using flutter which has the following functionalities:
   * An increment and decrement button
   * A display for counter
* Upload your code in the repository you created.
* A Google form will be floated in which you have to share the link of the repository and a screen recording of the working application.

 Here's a sample UI, you can use as a reference :
