# Flutter
* Flutter is an open-source UI framework developed by Google that allows developers to create cross-platform applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms using a single codebase. Traditionally, developing applications for different platforms required separate teams of developers using different programming languages and frameworks, resulting in increased development time and maintenance costs. Flutter addresses these challenges by enabling developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms. With Flutter, developers can build visually stunning, high-performance applications that can run on iOS, Android, web browsers, and even desktop platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Installation of flutter in Windows:
* follow the upcoming tutorial to install flutter: [Install Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqHOtlh3Dd4)
* Those who prefer documentation over video can visit: [Flutter install Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

### Testing of App:
* While programming an App, we will have to run our app multiple times to see its current status. 

  
* Running flutter on real device: Real devices provide an accurate representation of how your application will behave in the hands of real users.Real device testing allows you to assess the performance of your app in real-world scenarios.For this we can connect our phone to the programming device through USB cable. Here's a short tutorial for this:

* (Alternative) Emulator: Emulators are virtual devices that mimic the behavior of real devices. They provide a simulated environment to test and debug your Flutter application. If someone prefers app emulator over real device, here's a tutorial explaining steps to be followed:

*It needs to be noted that running an application in flutter may take time for the first time in both real device and virtal device (emulator).
