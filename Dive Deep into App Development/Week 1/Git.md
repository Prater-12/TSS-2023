# Basic Git and GitHub

## What's Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) widely used in software development. It helps developers track changes made to their codebase, collaborate with teammates, and manage different versions of their projects. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, merging their changes seamlessly and efficiently.Now, you may ask what's Version Control? Version control is a system that helps track and manage changes made to files and projects over time. It allows developers to keep a record of modifications, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. 
## What's GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories. It offers a robust set of features and tools that facilitate collaboration, version control, and project management for software development teams. GitHub serves as a central hub for developers to store, manage, and share their code with others.
